normalize the time series on different nodes
check the results for all terms in Eq. 5 (the reconstruction error, the GLR, DGLR and DGTV term) with different parameters (e.g. mus)
try with increasing rhos in the training process
try to check the error with ground truth with the model-based approach
For feature extractors: input embeddings should have histories (signal values on previous time). That would count for the "correlations" between nodes

## 1. Data preparation
- Data normalization: normalize full sequence on each node
- Plot
  - Each term in Eq. 5 ($\Vert y - Hx\Vert_2, x^\top L^u x, x^\top \mathcal{L}^d_r x, \Vert L^d_r x\Vert_1$)
  - evaluate prediction: 
-
