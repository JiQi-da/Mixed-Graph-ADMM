in Jupyter Notebook:
- visualize a neighborhood of each node, see the signal trend (correlated or not?)

in `ADMM.py`:
- [Done] dual residuals $\Vert x^{\tau+1} - x^\tau\Vert$ and delta x for each time step
- the differentials, share the paper with Gene
- convergence speed of undirected version

in `utils.py`:
- change directed graph into line graphs
- change edge weights into only 0/1 to see the connections
- condition number of $\mathbf{L}^u, \mathbf{L}^d$. Especially $\mathbf{L}^u$.

Done:
- Visualizing regularization terms DGTV, DGLR, GLR
- adding dual residual
